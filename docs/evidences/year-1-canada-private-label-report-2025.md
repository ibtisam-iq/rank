# Year-1 Operational Review

## Introduction

This is a **Year-1 operational review** of an Amazon Private Label business that I have been **building and managing continuously from inception**.

The report documents **how execution and capital were deployed during the first year**, and how those decisions translated into a live, revenue-generating operation that **continues beyond the reporting period**.

This review represents a **formal operational checkpoint**, not the conclusion of a project.

## Executive Summary

This report reviews the **first operational year** of an Amazon Private Label business managed end-to-end under my direct execution.

During this period, the business progressed through two natural operating cycles:

* A **build and launch preparation cycle**, where capital was deployed in controlled stages to validate products, suppliers, and logistics.
* A **live marketplace cycle**, where products became active and began generating revenue under real operating conditions.

By the end of the reporting period, the account had **successfully transitioned into live selling**, generating measurable revenue and consistent unit movement during the final quarter of the year.

The business **remains active and under ongoing management**, with optimization and scaling continuing beyond this review.

## Phase 1 — Private Label Build & Capital Deployment (Pre-Launch)

Phase 1 documents the **complete build cycle** of the private label operation up to the point where inventory became live on Amazon.

This includes execution related to product validation, supplier sourcing, manufacturing, quality control, logistics, and listing readiness.

To maintain clarity, Phase 1 is presented through **two complementary analytical views** that describe the **same execution cycle from different allocation perspectives**.

## View A — Time-based Capital Deployment

### Scope

View A presents **when capital was deployed** and **which operational milestones triggered expenditure**.

Only actions resulting in **direct financial outflow** are reflected numerically.
Operational work without immediate cost is referenced only where it explains capital decisions.

The focus remains on **decision-driven spending**, not activity narration.

### Month-wise Capital Deployment & Activities

## View B — Product-attributable Capital & Launch Investment

View B reorganizes pre-launch investment from a **product-centric perspective**.

To ensure analytical accuracy, costs are classified as follows:

* **Business-level setup costs** support the operation as a whole.
* **Shared operational costs** benefit multiple products.
* **Product-attributable costs** are directly linked to making a specific product launch-ready.

Only product-attributable costs are included in this view.

### Scope

While View A explains **when** capital was deployed, View B explains **how capital was absorbed at the product and SKU level**.

This enables clear visibility into per-product investment intensity, SKU structure, and inventory formation prior to sales.

### Product Capital Deployment

- Product 1 was launched as one SKU (Pack of 1)
- Product 2 inventory was split into two SKUs:
    - 600 units → Pack of 2 (300 packs)
    - 400 units → Pack of 1

| Product   | Units Ordered | SKU Structure                  | Manufacturing (Initial) | Manufacturing (Balance) | **Inspection** | **Freight**  | Images & Media | **Total** |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Product 1 | 500           | Single SKU (Pack of 1)         | 1,087.30                | 2,492.79                | 171.39         | 1,766.13     | 618.00         | **6,135.61**                 |
| Product 2 | 1,000         | 2 SKUs (Pack of 1 & Pack of 2) | 280.00                  | 1,285.24                | 142.53         | 597.00       | 625.00         | **2,929.77**                 |
| **Total** | **1,500**     | **3 SKUs**                     | **1,367.30**            | **3,778.03**            | **313.92**     | **2,363.13** | **1,243.00**   | **9,065.38**                 |

### Capital Reconciliation — View A vs View B

The variance between View A and View B represents **essential one-time and shared setup costs** that enable the operation but cannot be cleanly allocated to individual products.

This distinction is intentional and ensures transparency rather than omission.

## Post-Launch Capital Deployment (Year-1 Continuation)

The Phase 1 table above reflects **pre-launch build capital only**, covering structured execution **up to August 2025**, when the first inventory batch went live.

Following launch, the business continued to deploy capital as part of **normal live operations**.

These expenditures are **intentionally excluded** from the Phase 1 table to avoid mixing build-stage costs with operating activity.

**Key post-launch deployments during Year-1:**

* **Inventory Restocking (Live Operations)**

  Based on sell-through velocity and forward coverage planning, both active products were restocked.

  Initial manufacturing deposits (30% for one SKU, 50% for the other) resulted in a combined restock deployment of: **1,978.47**

* **Launch-Stage Demand Activation**

  Controlled unit distribution was executed to establish early listing credibility and conversion readiness under live marketplace conditions.

  Total activation cost across both products: **2,036.66**

These represent **operational scaling investments**, not build-stage costs.

### Year-1 Capital Summary (Complete)

* **Pre-Launch Capital (Phase 1 Table):** 10,590.98
* **Post-Launch Operating Capital:** 4,015.13

**Total Capital Deployed During Year-1:** **14,606.11**

This figure represents the **full first-year capital commitment**, covering both structured build-out and live operational execution.

## Phase 2 — Early Revenue Signals (Live Operations Checkpoint)

Phase 2 documents the **initial revenue behavior** observed after products went live.

This section does **not** attempt profitability analysis or business valuation.
Its purpose is to:

* Record **when sales began**
* Observe **month-wise revenue progression**
* Capture **SKU-level behavior under live conditions**

The business remains operational.
This phase represents a **checkpoint within an ongoing execution cycle**, not a terminal stage.

### Scope & Methodology

* No automated profitability software was used at this stage.
* All figures are **formula-driven and manually reconciled**.
* Minor variances are expected at this maturity level.

To maintain readability:

* Only **final outputs** are presented
* Full calculations and formulas are provided via the linked sheet

### Data Structure Logic

Phase 2 data is organized **SKU-first**, reflecting how the business is actually operated.

Inventory, advertising, and performance are managed at the SKU level.
Monthly and account-level totals are derived through aggregation.

### SKU-Level Revenue Snapshot

| SKU             | Month    | Sales         | Units Sold | Net Result  |

## Closing Notes

This report documents the **first operational cycle** of building and running an Amazon Private Label business — from structured capital deployment to early revenue validation.

Phase 1 focused on **controlled execution and risk-managed investment**.
Phase 2 captured **live marketplace behavior** without over-interpreting short-term financial outcomes.

The business **continues under active management**, with future reporting cycles expected to shift toward efficiency, scalability, and profitability analysis as operational maturity increases.

This document serves as:

* A transparent record for the client
* A verifiable operational case study
* A professional reference demonstrating end-to-end private label execution

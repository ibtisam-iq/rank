# Year-1 Amazon Private Label Operational Overview (Canada Marketplace)

> **This document is a Year-1 operational transparency artifact for an actively managed client-owned Amazon Private Label account.**

* **Reporting Period:** January 2025 – December 2025
* **Marketplace:** Amazon Canada
* **Currency:** Canadian Dollar (CAD)
* **Prepared by:** Muhammad Ibtisam Iqbal
* **Operational Role:** Amazon Private Label Operator & Growth Lead

## Introduction

This document exhibits a Year-1 operational overview of a client-owned Amazon Private Label business that was **planned, built, launched, and brought into live operation from inception** under my **structured, continuous, and retained execution**.

Its purpose is to serve as an **operational transparency artifact**, recording **what was executed and when** during the first year of account operation. The focus is on **execution milestones and client-side capital utilization**, rather than strategic evaluation or outcome judgment.

This is **not a project completion report**.  
It represents a **formal operational checkpoint** within an **ongoing account lifecycle**, with execution continuing beyond the reporting period.

> All business-related expenses during the reporting period were paid directly by the client using his own credit card, based on my execution planning and guidance. 

> Amazon-related charges (such as fees and advertising spend) were automatically **net-settled by Amazon** through its standard billing and payout settlement process.

## Executive Overview

This document summarizes the **first operational year** of the account, covering the transition from **initial build execution** to **live marketplace activity**.

During the reporting period, operations progressed through two natural execution cycles. 

* The first was a **build and launch preparation cycle**, where client capital was deployed in controlled stages to validate products, suppliers, logistics execution, and listing readiness.

* The second was a **live marketplace cycle**, where products became active on Amazon and began generating revenue under real fulfillment, advertising, and customer demand conditions.

By the end of the year, the account had **successfully transitioned into live selling**, with consistent unit movement observed during the final quarter.

Operations continue beyond this checkpoint into the next execution cycle, with early traction now translating into active cross-marketplace execution. The same private label listings are currently under expansion to the **United States** marketplace, while additional platform distribution (including **Walmart Marketplace**) has been identified as a subsequent phase following account onboarding.

## Phase 1 — Private Label Build & Pre-Launch Capital Utilization

Phase 1 documents the **complete pre-launch execution cycle**, covering all operational steps required to bring inventory live on Amazon.

This includes execution related to product validation, supplier sourcing, manufacturing coordination, quality inspection, logistics planning, catalog readiness, and listing asset preparation.

To maintain clarity, Phase 1 is presented through **two complementary allocation views**, each describing the same execution cycle from a different operational perspective.

## View A — Time-Based Capital Deployment

### Scope

View A records **when client capital was utilized** and **which execution milestones triggered expenditure**.

Only actions resulting in **direct financial outflow** are reflected numerically.
Operational work without immediate cost impact is referenced only where necessary to explain capital timing.

The focus remains on **decision-driven capital utilization**, not task narration.

> The table below summarizes finalized costs. All calculations are formula-driven and available in the linked Google Sheet.

## View B — Product-Attributable Launch Investment

View B reorganizes pre-launch capital utilization from a **product-centric perspective**.

To ensure clarity, costs are classified as:

* **Business-level setup costs**, supporting the account as a whole
* **Shared operational costs**, benefiting multiple products
* **Product-attributable costs**, directly required to make a specific product launch-ready

Only **product-attributable costs** are included in this view.

### Scope

While View A explains **when** capital was utilized, View B explains **how capital was absorbed at the product and SKU level** prior to sales.

This enables visibility into per-product investment structure and SKU formation without introducing outcome interpretation.

| Product   | Units Ordered | SKU Structure                  | Manufacturing (Initial) | Manufacturing (Balance) | **Inspection** | **Freight**  | Images & Media | **Total** |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Product 1 | 500           | Single SKU (Pack of 1)         | 1,087.30                | 2,492.79                | 171.39         | 1,766.13     | 618.00         | **6,135.61**                 |
| Product 2 | 1,000         | 2 SKUs (Pack of 1 & Pack of 2) | 280.00                  | 1,285.24                | 142.53         | 597.00       | 625.00         | **2,929.77**                 |
| **Total** | **1,500**     | **3 SKUs**                     | **1,367.30**            | **3,778.03**            | **313.92**     | **2,363.13** | **1,243.00**   | **9,065.38**                 |

### Capital Reconciliation — View A vs View B

The variance between View A and View B represents **essential shared and one-time setup costs** that enable account operation but cannot be cleanly assigned to individual products.

This separation is intentional and ensures transparency rather than omission.

## Post-Launch Capital Utilization (Year-1 Continuation)

The Phase 1 tables reflect **pre-launch execution only**, covering structured build activity through August 2025, when initial inventory became live.

Following launch, capital continued to be utilized as part of **normal live operations**.

These expenditures are **intentionally excluded from Phase 1** to avoid blending build-stage execution with live operating activity.

### Key Post-Launch Utilization During Year-1

* **Inventory Restocking (Live Operations)**
  Client capital was utilized for inventory replenishment based on sell-through behavior and forward coverage planning.

* **Launch-Stage Demand Activation**
  Controlled unit distribution was executed to establish early listing credibility and conversion readiness under live marketplace conditions.

These represent **operational continuation investments**, not pre-launch build costs.

### Year-1 Capital Summary (Complete)

* **Pre-Launch Capital Utilization (Phase 1):** 10,590.98
* **Post-Launch Operating Utilization:** 4,015.13

**Total Client Capital Utilized During Year-1:** **14,606.11**

This figure represents the **full first-year operational capital footprint**, spanning both structured build-out and live execution.

## Phase 2 — Early Revenue Signals (Live Operations Checkpoint)

Phase 2 records **initial revenue behavior** observed after inventory became live.

This section does **not** attempt profitability analysis, performance judgment, or business valuation.

Its purpose is to:

* Record **when sales activity began**
* Observe **month-wise revenue progression**
* Capture **SKU-level operational behavior under live conditions**

This represents a **mid-cycle operational checkpoint**, not a terminal assessment.

### Scope & Methodology

* No automated profitability tools were deployed at this stage
* All figures originate from **formula-driven Google Sheets**
* Values are **manually reconciled for presentation only**
* Minor variances are expected at this maturity level

Only final outputs are displayed here for readability.

## Closing Notes

This document records the **first operational cycle** of a client-owned Amazon Private Label business, covering execution from structured pre-launch activity through early live marketplace operation.

Phase 1 reflects **controlled build execution and disciplined capital utilization**.  
Phase 2 captures **initial live-market behavior** without over-interpreting short-term financial outcomes.

The account remains under active management beyond this checkpoint.  
This artifact serves as a **transparent operational record**, not a performance verdict or strategic forecast.

# Evidences

This section contains **verifiable operational artifacts** from client-owned Amazon accounts managed under retained, end-to-end execution.

Each entry represents **real execution**, not theoretical examples — documenting how accounts were onboarded, built, operated, and progressed over time across different business models and marketplaces.

The purpose of this section is **transparency**, not promotion.

## Amazon Wholesale

### U.S. Marketplace

**Multiple Client Accounts — Closed & Completed Engagements**

Wholesale operations were executed across multiple client-owned accounts under authorized reseller arrangements.

Execution scope included:

- Brand, distributor, and wholesaler onboarding  
- Authorized reseller and trade account setup  
- Supplier catalog analysis and product evaluation  
- Buy Box rotation monitoring and pricing control  
- Inventory purchasing, replenishment, and risk-managed scaling  
- Category ungating and compliance handling where required  

Wholesale execution followed a **continuous sourcing and evaluation cycle**, not one-time product selection.

Detailed case documentation is selectively published where disclosure is appropriate.

#### Supporting Asset (Wholesale Infrastructure)

During wholesale operations, a **supplier intelligence database** was built and maintained, containing **1,700+ verified U.S.-based brands, distributors, and wholesalers**, categorized by industry and eligibility.

This database was used internally for:

* Supplier sourcing
* Trade account expansion
* Ongoing product discovery

## Notes on Interpretation

- All accounts documented here are **client-owned**
- Financial transactions were executed either **directly by clients** or **under delegated purchasing authority**, depending on engagement structure
- Execution, planning, and operational control were handled under **retained engagement**
- Inclusion here does **not** imply exclusivity to a single client or marketplace  

This section will continue to expand as additional accounts and reporting cycles are documented.

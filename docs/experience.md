# Experience

**How I moved from learning Amazon to operating live private label businesses.**

### Exposure & Self-Learning (2020–2021)

- Began learning Amazon fundamentals independently
- Studied platform mechanics, seller workflows, and private label concepts
- Consumed recorded sessions, documentation, and practical material
- Built theoretical understanding before touching live accounts

This phase established foundational platform literacy, not execution.

### First Live Accounts & Wholesale Entry (2022)

- Entered Amazon operations through live client accounts
- Started with wholesale execution to gain real operational exposure
- Built accounts from zero, including:

  - Business email setup
  - Seller Central account creation
  - Initial catalog and compliance handling

- Learned Amazon operations directly inside active accounts rather than simulations

This phase transitioned knowledge into hands-on execution.

### Multi-Account Operations & Team Execution (2023)

- Managed multiple Amazon wholesale accounts simultaneously
- Built a small execution team to support daily operations
- Gained experience handling:

  - Account instability
  - Profitability pressure
  - Platform risk and operational failures

- Worked across different client requirements and operating styles

This phase exposed the limitations of wholesale as a long-term model.

### Strategic Shift to Private Label & Multi-Account Execution (2024–Present)

From 2024 onward, my work transitioned decisively into **private label–focused execution**, moving beyond wholesale-heavy operations into building, operating, and supervising private label brands across multiple markets.

This phase includes both **direct hands-on execution** and **execution under my supervision**, reflecting how private label work scales in real service environments.

#### Direct Private Label Execution

- Continued operating an existing **US-based account**, transitioning it from wholesale into private label and managing live marketplace execution
- Built and operated a private label account in **Canada**, documented through a complete Year-1 operational and financial report
- Led end-to-end execution including sourcing, manufacturing coordination, listings, advertising, and operational decision-making

#### Supervised Private Label Builds

- Oversaw private label execution for additional client accounts where:

  - Day-to-day execution was delegated
  - Strategic decisions, validation steps, and execution flow remained under my supervision
  
- These supervised builds included private label operations across:

  - **Australia**
  - **UAE**

Across all accounts, my role remained consistent:

- Defining execution frameworks
- Validating product and supplier decisions
- Guiding launch and operational strategy
- Reviewing outcomes, risks, and next steps

This phase represents the shift from **single-account execution** to **multi-account private label operations**, combining hands-on building with structured delegation.

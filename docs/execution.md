# Execution

This documents **how I build Amazon private label accounts from scratch**, specifically during the **pre-launch phase**.

My strongest execution experience is in **taking an account from zero to launch-ready**, not inheriting already-running accounts and making surface-level changes.

What follows is the **actual operational flow** I use before a product ever goes live.

---

## Scope of Execution

This execution framework applies to:

* New Amazon private label accounts
* Products being launched for the first time
* Situations where capital risk must be controlled before revenue exists

The goal at this stage is **not scale**.
The goal is **validated launch readiness**.

## Pre-Launch Execution Flow

### 1. Broad Product Research

I start wide.

Multiple product ideas are explored simultaneously instead of forcing a single idea too early.
This avoids emotional attachment and keeps decision-making objective.

Focus areas include:

* Demand presence
* Market saturation
* Listing quality gaps
* Operational feasibility

Only products that survive this initial filtering move forward.

---

### 2. Iterative Shortlisting

Shortlisted products are refined through multiple passes.

At this stage, I deliberately eliminate ideas that:

* Look attractive on paper but fail operationally
* Depend on fragile pricing
* Cannot be differentiated meaningfully

The objective is not to find a “winning product”, but a **defensible first product**.

---

### 3. Competitor Identification & Benchmarking

For each shortlisted product:

* Direct competitors are identified
* Listing structures are analyzed
* Offer positioning is reviewed

Where required, competitor units are ordered to a home address (Canada) for **hands-on comparison**.

This step is critical for understanding:

* Actual product quality
* Packaging standards
* Common weaknesses that can be corrected

---

### 4. Supplier Sourcing & Validation

Supplier sourcing is done in parallel.

For each product:

* Multiple manufacturers are contacted
* Quotations are compared across pricing, MOQs, quality, and responsiveness
* Supplier capability is evaluated beyond just cost

No supplier is finalized based on price alone.

---

### 5. Sample Production & Review

Samples are produced only after supplier shortlisting.

These samples are:

* Physically inspected
* Compared against competitor units
* Reviewed for quality gaps, packaging issues, and improvement areas

Feedback is sent back to suppliers before any bulk commitment is made.

---

### 6. Controlled Manufacturing Commitment

Manufacturing is committed in **stages**, not all at once.

* Initial payments secure production slots
* Balance payments are released only after validation checkpoints
* Third-party inspections are used before shipment authorization

This approach limits downside risk while maintaining momentum.

---

### 7. Parallel Listing Preparation

While manufacturing is in progress, listing work runs in parallel.

This includes:

* Keyword research
* Listing structure planning
* Bullet points and descriptions
* Backend attribute setup

Listings are not treated as an afterthought once inventory arrives.

---

### 8. Logistics Planning & FBA Readiness

Before inventory is dispatched:

* Shipment workflows are planned
* FBA requirements are validated
* Labeling and compliance issues are resolved in advance

The goal is to avoid reactive fixes once inventory is already in transit.

---

## Execution Principles I Follow

Across all steps, a few principles remain constant:

* Capital is deployed **only after validation**
* Tasks are sequenced based on necessity, not habit
* One-time decisions are not rushed
* Tools and subscriptions are adopted only when justified by stage

These principles come from experience building accounts from scratch, not from templates.
